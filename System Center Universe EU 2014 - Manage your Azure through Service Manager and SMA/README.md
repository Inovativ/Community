# System Center Universe 2014 - Manage your Azure through Service Manager and SMA
#### By Kurt Van Hoecke and Stijn Callebaut

Join us in this session where Kurt Van Hoecke (MVP) and Stijn Callebaut (PS guru) are going to demonstrate the power of Service Management Automation (SMA),   
PowerShell and Service Manager to manage your Azure environment.   
During this session we are going to explain and demonstrate the added-value of automation. The elements of automation, PowerShell logic and the integration   
of the processes are the focus points for this automation trip. Azure public cloud is targeted in this automation scenario where we will make use of different  
System Center products to submit and provision the request. Less slides, lots of demonstrations where we will elaborate on the configuration that supports the scenarios
