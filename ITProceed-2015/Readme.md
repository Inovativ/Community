#Automate yourself â€“ Service Management like a Boss
#### By Kurt Van Hoecke and Stijn Callebaut

Join us in this session where we are going to demonstrate the power of Service Management Automation (SMA), PowerShell and Service Manager to manage your environment.   
During this session we are going to proof the added-value of automation. The elements of automation, PowerShell logic and the integration of the processes are the   
focus points for this automation trip. It will be an iterative approach where we start with the basics and end with the complete automate process.   
The Azure public cloud is targeted in this automation scenario where different System Center products are involved to submit and provision the request.   
Less slides, lots of demonstrations how you need to build rock solid automations.
